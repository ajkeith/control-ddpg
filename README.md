# Continuous Control

### Single Agent
Single agent approach is in control_vanilla.ipynb with ddpg_agent_vanilla.py and model_vanilla.py based on the drlnd example for the pendulum ddpg. 

### Multi Agent
Multi agent approach based on the benchmark implementation in control.ipynb with ddpg_agent.py and model.py slightly modified to include all the benchmark modifications plus tweaking hyperparameters and cooling the OU noise over time.
